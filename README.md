# Urban Cup 2023

## Dear Participants,
Welcome to the Urban Cup of the first Research Summit on Urban Science and Human Dynamics! We sincerely invite you and your team to join the fascinating journey towards computational urban science for sustainability and social good! With fine-grained data on urban mobility, local infrastructure, land use, gas emission as well as poverty, health insurance, education attainment, etc., we welcome you to submit an original and publicly understandable impression of urban phenomena, patterns, or connections concerning urban sustainability and social good. The impression should be aesthetically, scientifically, and accurately visualized based on your data analysis and described within 500 words in English. Two or more forms of the provided data should be used, and additional information (e.g., Internet activities) may but need not be linked to. Please also make sure to submit the source codes that guide you to your amazing discoveries.

Please summarize the impression in a one-page slide, format your submission as this template, and provide a separate explanatory description of your findings of up to 500 words. Each team should consist of no more than 3 people, with at least one team member present at the conference venue to present the impression. Please fill this contribution statement and upload all three files to XXX by August 5th @ 8am (UTC/GMT+08:00) to complete the submission. Late submissions will not be considered.

## Datasets
Six population-scale datasets are provided: mobility dataset, carbon emission dataset, air pollution dataset, population characteristic dataset, semantic attribute data, and basic geographic statistics data.

### 1. Mobility dataset
This dataset is extracted from SafeGraph. It details the monthly population movement between CBGs within the 10 largest cities in the United States from 2018.1 to 2022.4. The movements were aggregated from anonymized mobile devices. Please click here for more details about the dataset.

### 1. Carbon emission dataset
This dataset is collected from Open-source Data Inventory for Anthropogenic CO2 (ODIAC). It records the CO2 emission within the 10 largest cities in the United States between 2018 and 2021. The data provides monthly CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion, cement production and gas flaring on a 1x1 km spatial resolution.

### 1. Air pollution dataset
This dataset is derived from the Environmental Protection Agency of the United States. It is collected from air quality monitors and consists of the daily O3, SO2, NO2, CO, PM2.5, and PM10 information across the United States between 2018 and 2021.

### 1. Population characteristic data
This dataset is obtained from American Community Survey (ACS), Earth Observation Group and OpenStreetMap. It provides both CBG-level and city-level poverty, health insurance, education, income Gini & light Gini, and built environment & racial segregation data from 2014 to 2023 across the 10 largest cities in the United States. Please click here for more details about the dataset.

### 1. Visual semantics data
This dataset provides semantic attributes processed from satellite remote sensing data. It depicts both CBG-level and city-level urban infrastructural information from 2014 to 2023 across the 10 largest cities in the United States. Please click here for more details about the dataset.

1. Basic geographical information data
This dataset consists of basic geographical information of CBGs across the 10 largest cities in the United States between 2014 and 2021. It records the city, area, population, centroid, and boundary of the CBGs within each year.
