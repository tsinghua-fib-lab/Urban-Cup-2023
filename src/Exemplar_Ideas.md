# Exemplar Ideas 

### 1. How air pollution affects experienced segregation 
Experienced segregation is defined as how likely urban dwellers can encounter others from different social classes [1], which is an important metric for urban inclusiveness. Air pollution will likely reduce urban mobility [2]. Therefore, it is interesting to evaluate the potential link between air pollution and urban experienced segregation. 

**Datasets involved**: Mobility dataset, Population characteristic dataset, Air pollution dataset

### 2. How urban infrastructure affects carbon emission 
Cities are major contributors to carbon emissions. Urban infrastructure, including transportation systems, buildings, energy supply, and waste management, plays a critical role in shaping the environmental sustainability of cities. It is interesting to investigate the how infrastructures in multiple cities affect carbon emission, for example, what infrastructure contribute most to emission, which can provide valuable insights for policymakers and urban planners to develop sustainable and low-carbon cities.

### 3. Does COVID hindered sustainable development? 
Previous studies have witnessed reduction in human activity during the COVID [1, 2], which raise the concern that COVID may disrupt the efforts toward sustainable development. It is interesting to use datasets including mobility, visual semantics, built environments to assess the speed of sustainable transition before and after COVID, for instance, the expansion of greenlands, sports fields, and the increasing communications between neighbourhoods of diverse backgrounds. 
**Datasets involved**: Mobility dataset, Population, Visual Semantics, (+COVID-19 dataset)

### 4. Urban facility and inequality
Retrieve the number of sports fields and investigate whether certain marginalized groups are more disadvantaged in the provision of sports fields. Explore its correlation with health insurance and health attainment. Determine the influence of the construction of new sports fields on local health and education. 

**Datasets involved**: Population, Visual Semantics


### 5. Road density and urban vitality
Examine the changes in the desity of driving/cycling/walking roads and explore its correlation with urban vitality characterized by visitations. 

**Datasets involved**: Mobility dataset, Population 


### 6. Environmental inequality
